# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?

Admittedly, it's not a strength of mine, since I can get bogged down in wanting to find an answer when I'm stuck on one particular problem. I wouldn't say I'm awful at it either. I find taking time to understand and preview what I need to accomplish in a day helps to identify where my time is most optimally used.

- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is?

A function is a repeatable set of instructions that we can tell a computer to perform by calling the name of the function with () and including additional information inside the () if needed.

- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.

parameters are placeholder variables that are declared when constructing a function. Arguments are included when a function is called and are substituted for the parameters when the function executes. The order of arguments must match the order of parameters or the function may throw a runtime error, or even worse, return a semantic error.

- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to bring to your Small Group?
If we have time I'd love to talk about the concept of semantic errors.
